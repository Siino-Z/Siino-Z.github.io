# Sinothabo Zwane's Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics portfolio. Here, I showcase my projects, skills, and experiences in data science, machine learning, and analytics. This site is hosted using GitHub Pages and built with the [GitHub Pages template](https://pages.github.com/).

## About Me
I am an emerging Data Scientist with a passion for translating raw data into actionable insights. I have a background in Medical Science and Data Science, combining scientific knowledge with analytical expertise. My career is centered around research, innovation, and data-driven decision-making.

My true passion lies in innovation. I aim to create solutions that solve problems across various industries. Ultimately, I want to contribute to improving the lives of South Africans, which also drives my deep interest in policy and research.

## Projects

### 1. Movie Recommendation System - [https://github.com/Siino-Z/Movie-Recommender-Engine]
**Problem Statement:**  
The challenge was to construct a recommendation algorithm capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences. Leveraging the enriched MovieLens dataset, augmented with additional metadata and user-generated tags, I developed a robust recommendation system that enhances content discovery and user satisfaction.

- **Techniques Used:**
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - External Databases: IMDb, TMDB

- **Conclusion:**
  - **User Preferences:** Distinct user segments with varying tastes and interests were identified.
  - **Movie Popularity:** Certain movies consistently receive higher ratings and more views.
  - **Feature Importance:** Movie genre, cast, and crew play varying roles in predicting user ratings.
  - **Model Performance:** Our models show reasonable prediction accuracy, but further fine-tuning could improve the system.

  | Model              | RMSE       |
  |--------------------|------------|
  | KNNWithZScore       | 1.039      |
  | BaselineOnly        | 0.974      |
  | SVD                | 0.971      |
  | SVDpp              | 0.968      |
  | CoClustering        | 1.121      |

- **Technologies Used:**
  - Python, scikit-learn, Surprise, IMDb API, TMDB API

### 2. Climate Change Sentiment Analysis - [https://github.com/Siino-Z/Climate-Change-Sentiment-Analysis)]
**Problem Statement:**  
This project focuses on developing a robust Machine Learning model capable of classifying an individual's belief in climate change based on their tweets. The objective was to categorize sentiments into classes such as Pro, Neutral, Anti, and News, providing businesses with a comprehensive overview of public sentiment.

- **Techniques Used:**
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning models

- **Insights and Conclusion:**
  - **Strategic Communication:** Tailor messages based on real-time sentiment trends.
  - **Targeted Outreach:** Identify influential voices and topics within the environmental discourse.
  - **Crisis Management:** Detect shifts in sentiment for proactive response.
  - **Campaign Effectiveness:** Gauge public response to initiatives in real-time.

- **Model Performance:**
  | Model                   | Accuracy  |
  |-------------------------|-----------|
  | Multinomial Naive Bayes  | 67.92%    |
  | Logistic Regression      | 73.20%    |
  | Support Vector Machine   | 74.08%    |
  | Random Forest            | 71.24%    |
  | SGD Classifier           | 71.74%    |
  | Ridge Classifier         | 73.96%    |

- **Technologies Used:**
  - Python, scikit-learn, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Twitter API
