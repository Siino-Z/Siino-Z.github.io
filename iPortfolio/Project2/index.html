            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project showcases my proficiency in developing a machine learning recommendation system to predict user ratings for movies 
                based on their historical interactions. The primary objective was to enhance personalized movie recommendations for users, 
                similar to systems used by streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

                <li><strong>Dataset Used:</strong> <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">MovieLens Dataset</a></li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Predict how users will rate movies they haven't seen using collaborative and content-based filtering methods.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Data Wrangling and Exploration -->
            <div>
                <h3>1. Data Wrangling and Exploration</h3>
                <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Data Preprocessing, Feature Selection, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</p>
                <p>
                    The initial phase involved handling large-scale datasets, merging information across multiple sources, and cleaning up irregularities like 
                    missing data. Key transformations included cleaning and normalizing user ratings, and extracting relevant metadata like movie genres, release dates, 
                    and actors.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Genre-based preferences, skewed ratings distributions.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>2. Feature Engineering</h3>
                <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Feature Engineering, Data Augmentation</p>
                <p>
                    I engineered features like average ratings per genre and user biases, helping the model align recommendations with user preferences. 
                    Temporal trends were also incorporated to enhance predictions.

                <h3>3. Model Development</h3>
                <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Hybrid Modeling</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative Filtering:</strong> Used kNN, SVD, and SVD++ to recommend movies based on user-item interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content-Based Filtering:</strong> Built recommendations using movie metadata such as genres and cast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Model:</strong> Combined collaborative and content-based methods for more robust predictions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Visualization</p>
                <p>Evaluated the models using RMSE to quantify prediction accuracy. The best-performing algorithm was Co-Clustering, with an RMSE of *1.13*.</p>

                <p>
                    The models were evaluated using RMSE, with Co-Clustering performing best in minimizing prediction error, followed by SVD++.

            <h2>Conclusion & Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                The Movie Recommendation Engine successfully predicted user ratings with high accuracy. Co-Clustering emerged as the best-performing model, 
                reducing RMSE significantly. Moving forward, the next steps include hyperparameter tuning and experimenting with deep learning models like 
                neural collaborative filtering to further enhance performance.
